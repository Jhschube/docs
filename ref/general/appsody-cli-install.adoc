= Installing Appsody CLI 

== Prerequisites
* Mac OSX - We plan to support more oeprating systems in the future.
* Docker - Appsody projects run in docker containers; follow the instructions on the Docker website to get Docker setup: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install
* Xcode Command Line Tools - run `xcode-select --install` from terminal


== Installing the Appsody CLI 
On Mac, you can install the Appsody CLI with homebrew. All you need to do is set up the tap and run the install.

 homebrew install appsody 
 homebrew tap appsody/appsody

To uninstall Appsody, run `brew uninstall appsody`.

*NOTE*: If you are re-installing the CLI or updating to a newer version, to avoid compatibility issues between versions,  delete your existing ~/.appsody directory: `rm -rf ~/.appsody`. You might also want to do this if you are uninstalling Appsody as it will not be deleted by default.
